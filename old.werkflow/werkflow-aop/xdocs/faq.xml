      <subsection name="Why do we need another workflow project?">
     
        <p>
        The implementor and organization funding the
        development of <code>werkflow</code> felt that existing open-source
        solutions were insufficient for their needs in another project.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="How are other projects insufficient?">
        <p>
        Most of the other workflow projects deal directly with
        user-interface flows or otherwise interactive processes.
        While this is useful, we needed a workflow system that
        could also coordinate large-scale and long-term business
        process flows.  Ideally, a single engine could address both
        user-interface flows and enterprise business processes.

      <subsection name="Who develops werkflow?">
        <p>
        <code>werkflow</code> is developed by the The Werken Company
        under contract with <a href="http://www.zenplex.com/">Zenplex</a>.
        The project lead is 
        <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/">Bob McWhirter</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Does werkflow conform to any standards (BPEL4WS, BPML, etc)">
        <p>
        At this time, no.  These standards tend to address a very small portion
        of the workflow space.  They also tend to be <i>block-based</i> workflow
        descriptions where <code>werkflow</code> is based upon <i>states and transitions</i>.

      <subsection name="What is petridish?">
        <p>
        <a href="http://petridish.werken.com/">petridish</a> is the generic 
        <b>petri net</b> framework that <code>werkflow</code> uses to
        model and execute processes.  It was also created by The Werken
        Company.
