  <section name="Overview">
    <p>
    <code>werkflow</code> is a flexible, extensible process- and 
    state-based workflow engine.  It aims to satisfy a myriad of
    possible workflow scenarios, from enterprise-scale business
    processes to small-scale user-interaction processes.  Using
    a pluggable and layered architecture, workflows with varying
    semantics can easily be accomodated.  Processes can revolve
    around documents, objects or any other entity.  The core
    <code>werkflow</code> engine can be accessed through a
    Java API, EJB, JMS, SOAP and other conduits.
