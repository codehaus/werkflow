\chapter{The Basic Personality}

\section{Introduction}

The \emph{basic personality} mimics many of the structures
of other \emph{block-based} syntaxes, such as BPML and BPEL4WS
but does not enforce the same semantic constraints.  The syntax of
the basic personality is fairly procedural and contains many common
control-flow structures.

The basic personality's syntax is accessed through XML tags from
the \verb|werkflow:basic| namespace.
