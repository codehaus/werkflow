      <subsection name="Why do we need another workflow project?">
     
        <p>
        The implementor and organization funding the
        development of <code>werkflow</code> felt that existing open-source
        solutions were insufficient for their needs in another project.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="How are other projects insufficient?">
        <p>
        Most of the other workflow projects deal directly with
        user-interface flows or otherwise interactive processes.
        While this is useful, we needed a workflow system that
        could also coordinate large-scale and long-term business
        process flows.  Ideally, a single engine could address both
        user-interface flows and enterprise business processes.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Who develops werkflow?">
        <p>
        <code>werkflow</code> is developed by the The Werken Company
        under contract with <a href="http://www.zenplex.com/">Zenplex</a>.
        The project lead is 
        <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/">Bob McWhirter</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Does werkflow conform to any standards (BPEL4WS, BPML, etc)">
        <p>
        At this time, no.  These standards tend to address a very small portion
        of the workflow space.  They also tend to be <i>block-based</i> workflow
        descriptions where <code>werkflow</code> is based upon <i>states and transitions</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our intention is to support many, if not all, of the various syntaxes
        and semantics for describing workflow.  Due to the theoretical
        underpinnings of the core, most any current specification can be
        modelled.  The syntax modules are seperate from the core and are
        easily extended and customized.
